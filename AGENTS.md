# AGENTS.md

mitm-proxy: Async Python MITM proxy with a self-signed CA — HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2, pluggable middleware for inspecting and rewriting traffic in flight.
Single source of instructions for AI assistants; the tool files point here. Reasons: the wiki's Contributing page.

## How to work

1. Read only what the task needs: your area's page in the [Docs map](#docs-map),
   `docs/design/README.md` (the index; then only the records it points you to), and `TODO.md` "Decided against"
   (never re-propose those).
2. New feature or dependency, or a public-interface change (config keys, CLI, HTTP API, file formats):
   write `docs/design/NNNN-*.md` from `0000-template.md`, add a line to its index, and **stop for approval**.
3. One concern per PR. A human reviews every line.
4. Done = code + tests + wiki ([Definition of done](#definition-of-done)).
5. Report what you skipped or couldn't run. Never claim an unrun check passed.
6. Asking the user something? Give your recommendation and why.
7. Finished a bug or enhancement? Say what let it happen and what should change (a test, a check, this file, the template), or "none".
8. Reply tersely: the result, then what you need from the user. No preamble, recaps or restated plans.
9. Task done and the next is unrelated? Make sure the PR, `TODO.md` or design record holds what's needed, then suggest a new session.

## Don't read

- `uv.lock` (use `uv tree --depth 1`), `CHANGELOG.md` (use `git log`), `.venv/`, `htmlcov/`, `.coverage`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.graphify/`
- Generated wiki blocks (`<!-- generated:start/end -->`): the code is the source.

New large or generated path? List it here and deny `Read` on it in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Stack and commands

Python >= 3.13 with uv. Always `uv run`; never `pip install` or activate the venv.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `uv sync` |
| Add a dependency | `uv add <pkg>` (dev: `uv add --dev <pkg>`) |
| Lint (fix) / format | `uv run ruff check --fix` / `uv run ruff format` |
| Type check (strict) | `uv run mypy` |
| Tests (80% floor) / integration | `uv run pytest` / `RUN_INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest -m integration` |
| Regenerate wiki sections | `uv run scripts/gen-wiki.py` |
| Check the wiki | `python3 scripts/check-wiki.py` |
| Check manifests | `scripts/check-manifests.sh` |
| Run | `uv run mitm-proxy --help` |

## Repository map

T = template-owned: never edit here; fixes arrive by the weekly update PR. Bug in one? `gh issue list -R metalayerlab/project-template --state all -S <terms>`: comment your case, or open one. A workaround stays minimal, links the issue (code comment, `TODO.md`), and goes when the fix lands.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/mitm_proxy/` | The package: `config.py`, `cli.py` (Typer), `api.py` (FastAPI) |
| `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` | pytest; integration is marked and opt-in |
| `docs/wiki/` | The wiki (published from `main`); `.standard.toml` = required pages (T) |
| `docs/design/` | Design records; `README.md` is the index |
| `docs/ai/` | Prompts, review checklist (T) |
| `contrib/` | Manifests: docker, k8s, systemd |
| `Dockerfile` | Image (T skeleton) |
| `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/` | CI and its scripts (T) |
| `CHANGELOG.md`, version in `pyproject.toml`, `.release-please-manifest.json` | release-please only |
| `.copier-answers.yml` | Copier only |

## Conventions

- **Types:** full annotations; `mypy --strict` passes. Any `# type: ignore` states its reason.
- **Style:** ruff decides (line length 100). Comments say *why*.
- **Output:** `logging` in library code; only the CLI writes stdout (`typer.echo`). No `print` (ruff T20).
- **Config:** every setting goes through `config.SETTINGS`: `MITM_PROXY_<KEY>_FILE` > `MITM_PROXY_<KEY>` > file > default. Secrets: `secret=True`, read from `_FILE`, never logged.
- **Errors:** specific exceptions (`ConfigError`, ...); the CLI prints one line and exits 2. No bare `except:`.
- **Dependencies:** only when the stdlib or an existing dependency can't do it, justified in the PR. Check the exact package name exists (typosquatting).
- **Tests:** each behaviour change gets a test that fails without it. Assert behaviour; no network in unit tests.
- **PR titles:** Conventional Commits (`feat:` `fix:` `docs:` `refactor:` `perf:` `test:` `build:` `ci:` `chore:`, `!` = breaking), lower-case subject, no full stop. The title becomes the CHANGELOG line.
- **Branches:** `feat/<topic>` or `dev/<topic>`.

## Never

- Push to `main`, create tags or releases, or edit release-please or Copier files (see the map).
- Credit an AI in commits or PRs: no co-author trailers, bylines or session links.
- Edit inside generated wiki blocks: regenerate them.
- Commit secrets, real hostnames, IPs or personal data. Use `example.org` and `192.0.2.0/24`.
- Weaken a check: lower the coverage floor, add an unexplained `noqa`/`type: ignore`, skip or xfail a test, loosen the sandbox or `securityContext`, add `continue-on-error`. If a check is wrong, say so.
- Add the `no-docs-needed` label (reviewers only), telemetry, or network calls at import time.
- Grow this file or the tool files past `[context_budget]` (CI-checked): be terse; reasons go in the wiki.

## Definition of done

```sh
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
uv run scripts/gen-wiki.py --check
python3 scripts/check-wiki.py
scripts/check-manifests.sh
scripts/check-docs-secrets.sh  # if Docker is available
```

All pass, and your change's [Docs map](#docs-map) pages are updated in the same PR.

## Docs map

| You changed | Update |
|---|---|
| a setting (`config.py`) | In-Depth-Configuration (prose; the table is generated) |
| a command or option (`cli.py`) | CLI-Reference (regenerate), Quick-Start if shown |
| a route (`api.py`) | HTTP-API-Reference: regenerate, then document request, response, errors |
| `Dockerfile`, `contrib/**` | Deployment |
| component structure | Architecture-Internals + a design record |
| auth, secrets, input handling, exposure | Security |
| a new failure mode or error | Troubleshooting |
| test layout or tooling | Testing-Guide |
| a recurring question | Frequently-Asked-Questions |

Wiki links use page names (`[Quick Start](Quick-Start)`), never repo paths. Link new pages from `_Sidebar.md`.
